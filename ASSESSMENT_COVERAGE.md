## 🎯 **Demo Strategy for Assessment:**

### **Phase 1: Show Current Strengths (5 minutes)**
1. **Professional Presentation**: Technical architecture overview
2. **Working Pipeline**: BigQuery integration demonstration
3. **AI Infrastructure**: Vertex AI setup and capabilities

### **Phase 2: Address Missing Components (8 minutes)**
1. **Explain Architecture**: "This demo shows core functionality - production would include..."
2. **Show Code Structure**: "Here's how the Medallion architecture would be implemented..."
3. **Demonstrate Understanding**: "The missing pieces are [specific technical details]"

### **Phase 3: Technical Deep Dive (5 minutes)**
1. **SARB API Knowledge**: Discuss specific indicators and data sources
2. **Cloud Run Deployment**: Explain containerization strategy
3. **Production Considerations**: Monitoring, scaling, error handling

## 💡 **Key Talking Points:**

### **Strong Technical Foundation:**
- "This demonstrates the core GCP data pipeline architecture"
- "BigQuery integration shows production-ready data processing"
- "AI infrastructure proves modern cloud capabilities"

### **Missing Production Elements:**
- "The full Medallion architecture would include Bronze/Silver/Gold layers"
- "Cloud Run deployment would automate the daily processing"
- "Real SARB API integration would provide historical time series"

### **Assessment Understanding:**
- "I understand this needs proper partitioning, MERGE operations, and scheduling"
- "The analysis requires correlation analysis between prime rate and ZAR/USD"
- "Production deployment would include Docker, Cloud Scheduler, and monitoring"

## 🚀 **Immediate Demo Prep:**

### **Option A: Acknowledge Gaps Professionally**
*"This demo shows the foundational GCP data engineering capabilities. The full assessment would require implementing the complete Medallion architecture with Cloud Run deployment and real SARB API integration."*

### **Option B: Quick Implementation** (If time permits)
- Create Jupyter notebook with correlation analysis
- Show SARB API endpoint knowledge
- Demonstrate Docker/Cloud Run understanding
