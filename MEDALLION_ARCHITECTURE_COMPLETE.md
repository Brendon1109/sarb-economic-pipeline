# 🏆 SARB Assessment - 3-Tier Medallion Architecture Implementation

## ✅ ASSESSOR FEEDBACK FULLY ADDRESSED

**Original Feedback:** *"I dont see the 3 tier architecture. The idea is that there is a raw layer where the data lands, staging where there are some transformations, reporting layer where report specific enhancements and KPI's are added. the AI insights can be kept separate in some summary table."*

**✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:** Complete 3-tier Medallion architecture with proper data engineering patterns

---

## 🎯 ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### 🥉 **BRONZE LAYER** - Raw Data Landing Zone
- **Purpose:** Exact copy of source data, no transformations
- **Table:** `bronze_raw_indicators`
- **Features:**
  - Ingestion timestamps for lineage
  - Source file tracking
  - No data transformations (raw data preservation)
  - 5 economic indicators stored

### 🥈 **SILVER LAYER** - Staging with Transformations  
- **Purpose:** Data cleansing, validation, and business logic
- **Table:** `silver_economic_indicators`
- **Features:**
  - Data quality flags and confidence scores
  - Business enrichments (period changes, trends)
  - Data validation and cleansing
  - Window functions for historical comparisons
  - 5 validated and enriched records

### 🥇 **GOLD LAYER** - Reporting Layer with KPIs
- **Purpose:** Report-specific enhancements and KPIs for business users
- **Table:** `gold_executive_dashboard`
- **Features:**
  - Executive KPIs (Economic Health Score 0-100)
  - Monetary policy stance classification
  - Risk assessment levels
  - Inflation target variance calculations
  - Report-ready dashboard data
  - 1 comprehensive dashboard record

### 🤖 **AI INSIGHTS** - Separate Summary Table
- **Purpose:** AI-generated insights separate from business data
- **Table:** `ai_economic_insights`
- **Features:**
  - Real AI analysis using Gemini 2.5 Flash
  - Executive summaries and policy assessments
  - Risk factor identification
  - Policy recommendations
  - Confidence scoring and provider tracking
  - 1 AI-generated insight record

---

## 📊 FINAL OPTIMIZED VIEW

**View:** `reporting_economic_dashboard`
- Combines all layers for end-user consumption
- Clearly separates business data from AI insights
- Optimized for executive reporting and dashboards

---

## 🚀 DEMO COMMAND

```bash
# Set environment and run the demo
cd c:\sarb-economic-pipeline
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSyBn7rHoJ2O4qWBYtKVRdmKSt1DbstVb2_Q"
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING="utf-8"
python src\final_three_tier_demo.py
```

**Expected Output:**
- ✅ BRONZE: Raw data landing (5 records)
- ✅ SILVER: Staging with transformations (5 records)  
- ✅ GOLD: Reporting layer with KPIs (1 dashboard)
- ✅ AI INSIGHTS: Separate summary table (1 insight)
- ✅ FINAL VIEW: Optimized for reporting

---

## 🏗️ DATA ENGINEERING BEST PRACTICES

### ✅ **Separation of Concerns**
- Business data (Bronze → Silver → Gold) completely separate from AI insights
- Each layer has a distinct purpose and transformation logic
- Clear data lineage from raw to refined

### ✅ **Data Quality & Validation**
- Quality flags and confidence scores in Silver layer
- Data cleansing and validation rules
- Business logic applied systematically

### ✅ **Enterprise Reporting**
- KPI calculations in Gold layer
- Executive dashboards ready
- Performance metrics and risk assessments

### ✅ **AI Integration**
- Real AI analysis using Gemini 2.5 Flash model
- Provider tracking and confidence scoring
- Graceful fallback for production reliability
